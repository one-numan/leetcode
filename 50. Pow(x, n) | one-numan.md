# One Line | Python | Time & Space O(1) ~ O(N)
___
# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- Using Python *Built-in* Operator 
- Named **Exponential Operator** 
- Values**Power
- But Its Only Works In Python

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Using Python Native Approch using Operator
 
# Complexity
### Time complexity:**
- $$O(1)$$ | No Loops and Recursive Function is Using.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

### Space complexity:
- $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        #Using Exponential Operators Values**Power
        return x**n
        
```
