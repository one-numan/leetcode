# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- Split()
- Slicing get the last Element
- length()

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Traditional Approach 
- Using Python Built-in Functions
# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
    - O(1) 
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- **Space complexity:**
    - O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
